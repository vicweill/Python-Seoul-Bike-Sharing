# Python-Seoul-Bike-Sharing

<i>I choosed this subject because the first one was not working. I looked over all the subjects and chose the Seoul Bike Sharing Demand because it was appealing for me and I find it realistic to study.</i>

## Run the Notebook
You'll need to execute this project to deploy it on Flask. I was not able to add the 'model.pkl' file on GitHub because of the 25Mo limit..
Everything compute well on Jupyter Notebook and it's not very long, you'll need couple of minutes for the largest plot and for the grid search. 

## Flask setups
When you'll have run the Notebook, you'll be able to take a look the flask part of the project. I had errors** when I was running it on VS Code on my computer but everything works fine on PyCharm, maybe you'll be more lucky than me. My IDE told me the link to access the flask project on my browser, but maybe you'll need to do this step manually. I hosted my work on the port 666, so you can go to <b>[this link](http://127.0.0.1:666)</b>

I found the template on internet and I wanted to improve but I had no time, maybe I will do it later.

** > I don't know why but VS Code doesn't find numpy when I try to import it. The problem might come from my computer.

## Conclusions
Firstly, I really enjoyed this project ! Maybe it was still light, but it was a concrete subject and I liked the fact that we were all alone with different subjects trying to find the best way to use our datasets. With this project I understood some new concepts from Python and machine learning and went further than the classes. I used internet to correct my mistakes, but also to have a better understanding of the functions I am using in the code and all of the parameters available.

This dataset was not very hard, and the data was clean. I was lucky to be able to choose the subject I wanted. As I told, I picked this one because I felt concern about this topic and I guess it helped me to do the project faster.

I tried to have a good process of exploring and cleaning the data, then tried some models and improving the best one. Maybe I could have tried to improve other models, but Random Forest is more often the best model. I hope it will be the best model when you run the code ^^

I think I could have find a better model if I took more time to explore the world wide web, or if I tried the cross validation. But anyway, I find the result quite good and the results are not bad.

Thank you for this project and for reading this note, and enjoy the project :)
